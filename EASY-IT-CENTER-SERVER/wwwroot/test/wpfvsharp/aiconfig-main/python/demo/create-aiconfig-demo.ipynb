      "Transformers are devices used to transfer electrical energy between two or more circuits using electromagnetic induction. They consist of two or more coils of wire wrapped around a core made of magnetic material, typically iron or steel. The primary coil, or input coil, is connected to the power source, and the secondary coil, or output coil, is connected to the load. \n",

The turns ratio between the primary and secondary coils determines the voltage transformation ratio. Transformers are commonly used to step up or step down voltages in electrical transmission and distribution systems, as well as in various electronic devices.\n",

They are vital components in power grids, allowing for efficient long-distance transmission of electricity at different voltage levels.
