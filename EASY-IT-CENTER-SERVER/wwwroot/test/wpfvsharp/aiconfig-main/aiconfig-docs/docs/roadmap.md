This project is under active development.

If you'd like to help, please see the [contributing guidelines](/docs/contributing).

Please create issues on our GitHub for additional capabilities you'd like to see.

Here's what's already on our roadmap:

  - We are also considering integrating with existing evaluation frameworks.
- Local editor for `aiconfig`
- OpenAI Assistants API support
- Multi-modal ModelParsers:
  - GPT4-V support
  - DALLE-3
  - Whisper
  - HuggingFace image generation
