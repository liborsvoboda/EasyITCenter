            “One of the most important operations necessary when text materials
            are prepared for printing or display is the task of dividing long
            paragraphs into individual lines. When this job has been done well,
            people will not be aware of the fact that the words they are reading
            have been broken apart arbitrarily and placed into a somewhat rigid
            and unnatural rectangular framework; but if the job has been done
            poorly, readers will be distracted by bad breaks that interrupt
            their train of thought.”

        Knuth started his revolutionary work of developing a computer program to
        produce high quality publication in the late ’70. The program he developed
        called TEX (pronounced “tek”) is highly regarded as the work that helps
        shape the field of digital typography and desktop publishing. It is still
        being widely used and constantly extended by many others up to today. One
        of the most intriguing inventions in this program is its ability to produce
        superior quality paragraph layout for printing and reading purpose – arguably
        comparable to the work manually done by most respectable publishers of the
        modern times.  This typographically beautiful paragraph layout is driven by
        a line breaking algorithm known as<span class="xd">&lt;</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>total-fit<span class="xd">&lt;/</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>
        or<span class="xd">&lt;</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>optimum-fit<span class="xd">&lt;/</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>
        algorithm. Some call the kind of paragraph
        produced by this algorithm<span class="xd">&lt;</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>Optimal Paragraph<span class="xd">&lt;/</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>

        In principle, the task of text formatting consists of two main components:
        choosing where to end individual lines and how to justify the lines. The first
        component may involve the task of word division called<span class="xd">&lt;</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>hyphenation<span class="xd">&lt;/</span><span class="xn">Italic</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>
        .
        Line justification is the task of fitting a line into a desired width. Usually
        it is done by distributing the extra space into or taking out excess space
        from inter-word spaces in the line. Line justification is strongly dependent
        to line breaking. When line breaking is done properly, justification can be
        done without the need to change the spacing too much and thereby avoiding
        holes between words that would distress the eyes of the reader.<span class="xd">&lt;/</span><span class="xn">Paragraph</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span><span class="xd">
    &lt;</span><span class="xn">Paragraph</span><span class="xd">&gt;</span>
        Unlike a standard line breaking algorithm which breaks the line without taking
        into account the line that may come after it, the total-fit algorithm breaks
        line by looking ahead on what may come later in the paragraph and make a single
        decision to break all the lines at once.  The main idea of the algorithm is to
        provide a way to break a paragraph into lines so that the inter-word spacing is
        balanced between all the lines of the paragraph. This is attained by choosing
        the sequence of breakpoints with the minimal total cost over all lines. The
        cost of a line depends on many factors that can affect the visual appearance
        of the line, such as the measure of inter-word space changing, the division of
        the last word of the line, etc.

        A paragraph is considered optimal when all inter-word spaces over all lines are set as
        close as possible to the ideal inter-word spaces. Therefore, an optimum paragraph is in
        fact a paragraph composed in such a way that the total contrast of inter-word spaces set
        in all lines with the ideal inter-word spaces cannot be reduced anymore.
