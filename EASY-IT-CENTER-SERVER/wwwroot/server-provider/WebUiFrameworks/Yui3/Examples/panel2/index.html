<p>I've been so disturbed by the connection between <a href="http://breastfeeding.blog.motherwear.com/2006/12/world_aids_day_.html">HIV/AIDS and breastfeeding</a>, and so impressed that this organization has managed to get boxes of milk half way around the world.</p>

													<div class="bd">Recently a prolific colleague, <a href="http://www.ausetdoula.com/us.php">Kimberly Durdin-James,IBCLC</a> brought up the epidemic of mothers, particularly low-income, minority mothers being given Depo provera in the hospital before lactation is established and before discharge. Women who have received breastfeeding information, been encouraged to breastfeed and have DECIDED to breastfeed who are now, unable to breastfeed. Lactation consultants will tell you story after story of mothers who struggle to bring in any milk supply at all after receiving an injection of Depo Provera. Even worse, how many mothers now think this is one more way that their body doesn't work; they could not produce milk for their baby. Yet, it didn't have to be that way. <br /><br />Do doctors know they are sabotaging their patients? Do they care? What information is out there?<br /><br />I decided to do some of my own research. Information online varies from site to site. The actual <a href="http://www.depoprovera.com/isitright.asp">Depro Provera</a> site says that women can use the medication after the birth of a baby. It does not specifically mention any affect on milk production. <br /><br />Various sites say it is compatible with breastfeeding or safe for the breastfeeding mother and baby.<br /><br />Other sites offer <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.com/reading_room/lam_fam.html">more specific guidelines</a>. The general consensus is to administer at 3 to 5 days if NOT breastfeeding and after 6-8 weeks (or after breastfeeding is well established) if breastfeeding. However, it is not listed as a "con" or reason not to choose Depo Provera. <br /><br />Depo Provera has a dark side, excluding its affect on lactation. Sara Littlecrow-Russell shares her experience with this form of birth control, doctor coercion and finding out about the potential side effects <a href="http://popdev.hampshire.edu/projects/dt/pdfs/DifferenTakes_05.pdf">here</a>. According to her article, Depro appears to be the contraceptive of choice for many government clinics and agencies and is growing in popularity in those settings. Interestingly, black teens are more than twice as likely as white teens to use it (19% compared to 8%). I have heard time and time again of it being given with and without consent to black mothers (some young, some low income, some not) in the hospital. Apparently some doctors are so concerned that these potentially "non-compliant" patients will either skip the 6 weeks appointment or come back pregnant that they are willing to trample on their right to make an informed decision (especially one they may not agree with). Why not teach these women how very important it is that they exclusively breastfeed to prevent the return of fertility until the 6 weeks postpartum check-up where they can discuss other options?<br /><br />Even if given "with consent", there are some valid concerns. Twelve years ago, four consumer groups including the National Black Women's Health Project banned together to ask for a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=12319319">moratorium on Depo Provera</a>. The FDA promised to "monitor any adverse health effects" and the groups asked for healthcare professionals to use a standard informed-consent form. Twelve years later, and as they say, "ain't nothin' changed". Women are still <a href="http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=12541&name=DEPO-PROVERA">reporting negative side effects</a> and have their stories online including <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/depo1/petition.html">a general Petition</a> against Depo provera and and a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?madp">Men's Petition</a>. The <a href="http://www.blackwomenshealthproject.org/aacontraception.htm">Philadelphia Black Woman's Health Project</a> states on it's web site:<br /><br />"While Depo is viewed as a drug of convenience, we maintain that it exacerbates pre-existing disease conditions.  Depo has been linked with long-term irreversible effects such as breast cancer and cervical cancer, both of which disproportionately affect Black women.  Depo is also associated with a thinning of the bones.  This places young women who use Depo at a higher risk for developing osteoporosis.  Other risks include increased depression, excessive weight gain, excessive bleeding, and loss of sex drive."<br /><br />Again, no mention of negative affect on milk supply, but honestly that may be the least of your problems with this contraceptive. What is scary, is that it not only takes away your ability to produce milk, but also takes away your ability to reap the protective nature breastfeeding offers against breast and cervical cancer. It is a "double whammy". But it prevents more "ghetto babies" right? Apparently that is the most important objective.<br /><br />Depo Provera may be a solution for some mothers in some situations. It is important that we give mothers the information, counseling and opportunity to make the best choice.  For breastfeeding mothers, especially mothers who already have social barriers against breastfeeding, we should do everything we can to eliminate barriers where we can.

													<div class="bd">This morning I looked out at our backyard and this is what I saw...<br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_7E20Fevrz2E/RbDKqT3cGDI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/Yo6NxhdBR2U/s1600-h/Jan+"><img alt="" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_7E20Fevrz2E/RbDKqT3cGDI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/Yo6NxhdBR2U/s320/Jan+%2707+018.jpg" border="0" /></a> Snow. No big deal, right? I mean, it's not even a lot of snow. But that's the problem. I live in New England, it's the middle of January, and this is the most snow I've seen this winter. Normally we would have been buried several times by now.<br />I bet you're still thinking, What's the big deal? And I can understand that. On one hand, I'm glad we haven't gotten snow because I hate snow, I hate driving in it, I hate the cold, etc. But on the other hand, the fact that we've only gotten this much snow scares the crap out of me. With all the information on global warming and an impending global disaster that I've heard about lately, I want snow. I want the winter to be colder. Because then I wouldn't be worrying about global warming, about what type of world my girls will be growing up in.<br />Am I the only one that is worried? Does this bother anyone else, or am I just being paranoid and neurotic?<br />And, just because she is so cute...<br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_7E20Fevrz2E/RbDKrD3cGEI/AAAAAAAAAGY/Pom0OEKen_I/s1600-h/Jan+"><img alt="" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_7E20Fevrz2E/RbDKrD3cGEI/AAAAAAAAAGY/Pom0OEKen_I/s320/Jan+%2707+017.jpg" border="0" /></a></div>

													<div class="bd">Well it's Friday again, and that means it's time for me to look back on the week and see how well I did with my goals.<br /><br />Weight: As part of the <a href="http://mom-o-matic.blogspot.com/2006/12/future-milfs-recap.html">Future <span>MILF</span> program</a>, I have to post weight I lost this week and total weight lost. <span>Drum roll</span>, please.....this week I lost......1lb. As you recall, <a href="http://adventuresofabreastfeedingmother.blogspot.com/2007/01/fantastic-friday.html">last week</a> I didn't lose any but didn't gain any either, and I figured it was due to the fact that I wasn't following my <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx">WW</a> points too well and eating constantly because the Guppy was nursing so much. Well this week the Guppy continued to nurse, and I continued to eat, but I tried to reach for healthier foods when I could. And I also picked up on my <span>exercising</span>. So, I'm happy with the 1lb weight loss, and since I'm nursing, that's the safe amount to lose each week anyway. This brings my total weight loss to 9lbs in 10 weeks. Another fantastic thing about my <span>exercising</span> is that I do a lot of toning <span>exercises</span>, so although I didn't lose much weight, the Knight says I <span>definitely</span> look more toned and thinner. Fantastic!<br /><br />The house: thanks to <a href="http://www.flylady.net/"><span>FlyLady</span></a>, this one is actually easy. As long as I get all my routines done, my house stays "guest-ready cleaned". In fact, the morning after my mom came home from London, she looked around the house and asked, "Who are you having over?"<br />"Um....<span>no one</span>"<br />"Oh....then why is the house so clean?"<br />This week I managed to work on some <span>decluttering</span>, so my bathroom is fully <span>decluttered</span> and my kitchen is halfway there. Thank you, <a href="http://www.flylady.net/"><span>FlyLady</span></a>.<br /><br />Finances: After much discussion, the Knight and I thought that the best option for us right now is to go on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_management_plan">Debt Management Plan</a>. I checked out the best programs and took some recommendations and the best one seems to be <a href="http://www.cccsintl.org/">Money Management International</a>, a non-profit organization that helps people get out of debt. After a counseling session, where they explained the ins and outs of the program, we have decided to start filling out the paperwork to sign up. If we had kept up our pattern of paying our debt as we had been, it would have taken us 34 years. On this program, paying the minimum payment, it will take us 4.5 years and they will save us over $22,000 in interest charges, not to mention late fees. I've also started teaching myself the ins and outs of the Knights retirement plan. After all, if we are going to depend on this money when we retire, it would help if we knew how the program worked. I've also looked into other books that I want to get from the library on how to save money and make your money work for you.<br /><br />Finally, the <span>environment</span>. Sadly, this one is the area I am slacking in. Although I am still living the <a href="http://sfcompact.blogspot.com/">Compact Life</a> and haven't bought anything new, we still haven't set up our recycling center. I also haven't gotten around to making cloth paper towels, dishcloths, and nursing pads, so we've still been using those disposable products. Hopefully this weekend I will get some time to sit down and complete those projects.<br /><br />Well, that's it for this week's Fantastic Friday. Not bad considering I had two sick kids to take care of, one of which would not let me put her down at all (thank you <a href="http://www.ellaroo.com/wraparound-carrier.php"><span>Ellaroo</span> Wrap</a>!).</div>

													<div class="bd">I haven't been posting much lately and that's because the girls are still trying to kick this cold that they've had for a month. I think the Mermaid is finally over it completely and the Guppy is doing better as well, today is the first day in a while that I have been able to put her down without her crying.<br /><br />I was thinking this morning about the meme I did and how I answered that the most fun job I had was working at my University's library. I would work the night shift with my friend and our supervisor, whose name was Julio.<br /><br />Julio grew up in <span>Puerto</span> Rico and was raised by his mother. He is one of the most open-minded and kind man I've ever known. He is also extremely smart. Julio knew the answer to almost any question we would ask him...our favorite game to kill the time was to try to stump him with a question. In the rare times when he didn't know the answer he would answer, "Well I don't know...let's look it up together" and we would.<br /><br />I <span>once</span> asked Julio how he came to know so much information and he attributed his knowledge to his mother. See, even though his mother was busy raising him and his siblings by herself, she always took the time to help them learn. If they had a question that she did not know the answer to, she would stop what she was doing, and say, "I don't know, let's look it up together" and they would. She encouraged them to read everything they could get their hands on and took them to the library frequently. I could tell Julio cared for his mother very much and that she had a profound influence on him, and I swore that I would strive for the same relationship with my children.<br /><br />All to often, as mothers, I think that at times we may be too busy to encourage our children's <span>curiosity</span> and desire to learn new things. Many times I hear mothers making up answers to questions that their children ask simply because they don't know themselves and are too busy to find out. I don't think that there really is anything wrong with that, and I do realize that some questions that children ask have answers that are too complicated for them. However, thanks to Julio, I have seen the results that can happen if a mother actually does take the time to help the child learn how to find the answers to their questions and learn. Now that the Mermaid is getting closer to school age and now that we have actually started some homeschooling, I resolve to try my hardest to take time to answer her questions as honestly as I can.<br /><br />After graduation, I went back to the library to talk to say hi to Julio when I was in the area. I found out that his mother had fallen ill and he had flown back to <span>Puerto</span> Rico to be with her. I never knew what happened to him after that, but I know that whenever either of my girls will ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I will think of him and his mother and if I can, I will answer with "Let's look it up together."</div>

													<div class="bd"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In an online discussion group I recently heard of a few cases of day care providers charging families more for serving babies pumped breastmilk than for feeding them formula.&nbsp; This was the first I'd heard of this practice, and I'm trying to figure out how widespread it is.</p>

<p><em>Has this happened to you or anyone you know?&nbsp; Please let me know by either leaving a comment below or sending me an email (see About page for email link)</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>I was floored when I heard about this issue.&nbsp; Here are just a few of the reasons why charging more for serving breastmilk is absurd:</p>

<p><strong>It's safe and requires no special storage.</strong>&nbsp; The Centers on Disease Control (CDC) states that breastmilk is not considered a <a href="http://breastfeeding.blog.motherwear.com//In%20health%20care%20speak%20they%20say%20it's%20not%20covered%20by%20&quot;universal%20precautions&quot;)">hazardous bodily fluid</a> (something requiring &quot;universal precautions&quot; in health care-speak).&nbsp; As such, it requires no separate storage, protection, or handling by a child care provider.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://motherwear.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/cid_image002.jpg"><img title="Cid_image002" height="194" alt="Cid_image002" src="http://breastfeeding.blog.motherwear.com/images/cid_image002.jpg" width="125" border="0" /></a>It's easy.</strong>&nbsp; Breastmilk is no more complicated to serve than formula, and does not require mixing and measuring as formula does.</p>

<p><strong>It saves them money.</strong>&nbsp; Babies receiving pumped milk are less likely to be sick, which means less disease spread among children in the center, and less absences for both babies and staff.&nbsp; This reduces a center's cost of operation.</p>

<p><strong>Babies are happier and less messy at day care.</strong>&nbsp; Breastmilk is more easily digested than formula, so breastfed babies are less fussy, spit up less frequently, and have less diarrhea - all things you want to avoid if you are a day care provider.</p>

<p>If you're preparing to return to work and your baby will be in day care, here's a nice <a href="http://www.eec.state.ma.us/docs/TABreastFeedingDayCareBrochure.pdf">handout</a> from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, for child care providers on meeting the needs of breastfed babies.&nbsp; My only complaint is that the storage time listed for milk kept in the refrigerator is way too conservative (it says 48 hours; <a href="http://www.medela.com/NEWFILES/faq/coll_store.html">Medela</a> says 5-7 days).&nbsp; </p></div></div>

													<div class="bd">Today we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Even the most white-bread public school history class includes a brief history of the speeches and non-violent protest work of Dr. King. If you need an overview of Dr. King and his work, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">here</a>. <br /><br />So in honor of Dr. King, I have decided to make my own "I have a Dream Speech". Thank you to <a href="http://www.kiddyhouse.com/Holidays/MLK/MLK.html">Martin Luther King Jr. for Kids</a> for the link to this idea. This is a great idea to try with your children too.<br /><br />"I Have a Dream Too!"<br /><br /> <br />I have a dream that one day this nation will value and support breastfeeding mothers and babies.<br /> <br />I have a dream that one day America will be a place that breastfeeding is the norm. <a href="http://www.theirbirthright.org/">After all, it is their birth right</a>. (Thanks, Kimberly!)<br /> <br />I have a dream that one day African-American babies will no longer have a greater risk of SIDS, morbidity, mortality, ear infections, obesity....the list of diseases that are more prevalent in the African-American children and adults is too long. One is too long. <br /> <br />I have a dream that the womanly art of breastfeeding will be reclaimed and respected.<br /><br />I have a dream today.<br /> <br />I have a dream that one day Black moms, White moms, Native moms, African moms, British moms, Christian moms, Jewish moms, Muslim moms, stay-at-home moms and working moms will all be able to breastfeed their babies/provide human milk so their children can get the start in life they deserve.<br /> <br />I have a dream today.<br /> <br />I have a dream that one day <a href="http://lalecheleague.org/philosophy.html?m=1,0,1">LLLI philosophy</a> will be the predominant parenting philosophy.<br /> <br />This is my hope and faith. With this faith we will be able to help mothers gain confidence, trust and pride in themselves as they realize they are the experts in their own babies.<br /> <br />This will be the day when breastfeeding is not "the best". It is normal, it is common, it is just what mothers and babies do.<br /><br />When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"</div>
