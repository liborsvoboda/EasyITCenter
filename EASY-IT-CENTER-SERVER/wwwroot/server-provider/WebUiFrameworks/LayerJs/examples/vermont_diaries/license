So,  you would like to share my comics?  That's perfectly fine as long as you give proper credit and don't manipulate the images.  You can translate,  make slideshows or videos without asking for my permission.  You cannot print my comics in any format or merchandise.  I don't do interviews or things of that nature because  I'm not fond of that.  Cheers!
