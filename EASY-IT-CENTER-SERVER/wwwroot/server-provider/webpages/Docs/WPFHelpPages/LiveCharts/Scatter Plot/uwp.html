<h3 class="important-tittle">Scatter Plot</h3>

<p>
    Every scatter series point in LiveCharts contains 3 properties, X, Y and weight, the size of every point will vary
    according to the point's weight, in this case all points have the same weight, see Bubbles example to watch how the
    weight property is applied.

    To keep this example always up to date it is directly pulled from the Github repository, the
    repo for simplicity uses the <i>UserControl</i> class to wrap every example, but you can use any
    container for your plots.
