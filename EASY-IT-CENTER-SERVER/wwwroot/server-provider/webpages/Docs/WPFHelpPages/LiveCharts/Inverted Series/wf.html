<h3 class="important-tittle">Inverted Series</h3>

<p>
    Inverting series in LiveCharts is practically automatic, you must use the inverted version of the series,
    then live charts will handle the inverted draw, notice the <a href="/App/examples/v1/wf/Types%20and%20Configuration">configuration</a>
    for Vertical and Horizontal series is different, and you must conciser this if plotting a custom type.
</p>

<p>
    Practically all series have a built in inverted version, for example the <i>LineSeries</i> class
    inverted version is <i>VerticalLineSeries</i> class, in
    <a href="/App/examples/v1/wf/The Cartesian Chart">The Cartesian chart article</a> you could find a full list with
    the supported series.
