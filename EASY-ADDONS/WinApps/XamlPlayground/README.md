## Sharing Xaml

XamlPlayground uses GitHub [gists](https://gist.github.com/) to publicly share your creations.

The gist must contain a file named *Main.axaml* and optional *Main.axaml.cs* with code behind. 

To share a xaml with others you should do the following:
* Create a gist with *Main.axaml*.
* Create an optional gist with *Main.axaml.cs*
* Append the gist ID to XamlPlayground URL. For example, to view [gist.github.com/6b6f586cecb37ada37da24c8e1fe408b](https://gist.github.com/6b6f586cecb37ada37da24c8e1fe408b) in XamlPlayground, use the URL [avaloniaui.github.io/XamlPlayground/6b6f586cecb37ada37da24c8e1fe408b](https://avaloniaui.github.io/XamlPlayground/6b6f586cecb37ada37da24c8e1fe408b).

Example gists:

* [gist.github.com/6b6f586cecb37ada37da24c8e1fe408b](https://gist.github.com/6b6f586cecb37ada37da24c8e1fe408b)
