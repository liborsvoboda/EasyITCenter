NPM is a package or module manager for Node.js packages or modules.  NPM gets installed along with Node.js.

When you install a package it gets stored in `node_modules` folder.
## How to download a package

```sh
npm install <package-name>
```

## How to use the package in your code

```javascript
let app= require('express');
// express is the package name
```

## Note

You can find thousands of packages for free @ [NPMJS](https://www.npmjs.com/) with verbose documentation.
